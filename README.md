JobNest is designed to be a bridge between job seekers and employers, simplifying the registration process and tailoring the experience to each user's needs. Its primary goal is to make job hunting and recruitment as straightforward and effective as possible. The platform's user-centric design is evident in its multi-step form, which breaks down a complex process into manageable chunks.

Key Features of the Platform (as per the code)
Dual-Role Functionality: JobNest is built to serve two distinct user types:

Job Seekers: Individuals looking for new career opportunities. Their registration form is tailored to collect information relevant to their job search, such as skills, experience, location, and a resume.

Employers: Companies looking to hire new talent. Their form focuses on company-specific details, including the company name, website, industry, and a mission statement.

Streamlined Onboarding: The multi-step registration form is the core of the user's initial interaction with the platform.

Step 1 (Account Details): Gathers fundamental user information (name, username, email, password), serving as the foundation for the user's profile.

Step 2 (Additional Details): Collects more specific information based on the user's role, ensuring that the platform's features and recommendations are highly personalized.

Step 3 (Social & Final Details): A crucial step for modern networking. It allows job seekers to link their social profiles (LinkedIn, X, Instagram, Facebook) and upload a resume, providing a comprehensive view of their professional presence. For employers, it's where they can upload their company logo and description to create a professional brand profile.

Modern and Intuitive UI: The use of Tailwind CSS suggests a commitment to a clean, responsive, and visually appealing design. The "glassmorphism" style and a clear progress indicator at the top of the form provide a modern, engaging, and easy-to-follow user experience.

Dynamic User Experience: The form is not static. It uses JavaScript to adapt in real-time. For example, selecting "Employer" instantly reveals the "Company Name" field, while hiding fields irrelevant to a job seeker. This dynamic approach prevents form clutter and reduces user confusion.

In summary, the provided code represents a sophisticated, user-friendly platform called JobNest. It's a job board that goes beyond basic registration by providing a specialized, role-based onboarding experience, highlighting the importance of a professional online presence, and using modern web technologies to create a seamless and efficient process for both job seekers and recruiters.
